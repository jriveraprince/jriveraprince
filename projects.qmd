## **Power in the Hands of Many: A Bioarchaeological Approach to Study Social Inequality in the Ancient Andes, North Coast of Peru (400-200 cal. B.C.)**

Since 2017, I have worked as one of the project bioarchaeologists of the Programa Arqueológico Huanchaco (PAHUAN, PI Dr. Gabriel Prieto, University of Florida). My own research program focuses on the study of the emergence of social inequality in small-scale maritime communities in the ancient Andes. I analyzed human remains and mortuary contexts from the José Olaya - La Iglesia Site (Moche Valley, North Coast of Peru), a cemetery of a small-scale fishing community during the late Early Horizon (400-200 cal. B.C.). Although most research in this period focuses on settlement patterns and architecture analysis, more recent emphasis on domestic settings investigates inequality within groups as part of large social systems, an approach that has revealed important information on past social dynamics.

However, little is known concerning how the emergence of inequality affected peoples' daily lives in this region from the perspective of human skeletons and their burial contexts. This project documented skeletal markers of health, lifestyle, nutrition, and stress to investigate whether these traits are potential indicators of social inequality. I also examined the mortuary contexts and grave goods to understand if (and if so, how) social distinction correlates with embodied inequality within the JO-IG cemetery. By combining both bioarchaeological and mortuary evidence, I was able to conduct a more holistic study to investigate the expression of social inequality in material remains during the late Early Horizon. Importantly, this project also contributed toour anthropological understanding of the emergence of social inequality from the perspective of individuals in small-scale communities.

This project was supported by: The Wenner-Gren Foundation Dissertation Fieldwork Grant (#10343), The U.S. Fulbright Open Research Grant (Perú), the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (#1842473), the Ford Predoctoral Fellowship, University of Florida International Center Research Abroad for Doctoral Students, and the UF Elizabeth M. Eddy Summer New Graduate Student Research Award.

## **Critical Knowledge Production and (Bio)Archaeological Research**

```

My research and publications are the result of my belief that we cannot study the past (especially histories of inequality), in an effective manner unless we address inequities in current archaeological practice. To this end, I have written on themes regarding critical knowledge production in archaeological and anthropological practice.

Based on a seminar on equity and archaeological practice (LeClerc et al. 2023), I have also published on equity in archaeological practice (Rivera Prince et al. 2022) with particular focus on exploring how various mechanisms work to produce inequitable realities for archaeological trainees and those engaged in archaeological practice. These papers were written with a large, collaborative community of coauthors using a practice we call Writing in Community (Rivera Prince et al. *n.d.*).

Archaeology uses numerous STEM-aligned methods rooted in the tenants of the scientific inquiry. There is much labor, time, and expertise that has gone into the development of these methods. As we enter a new field of critical inquiry and questioning our positionality as researchers and practicing archaeologists, their use may warrant critical reflection. 

A recent coauthored article with an environmental archaeologist and zooarchaeologist (Milton et al. 2023) is a call to (bio)archaeologists to critically evaluate the use of isotopic analyses in archaeological practice. We evaluate the motivations for running isotope analyses with human remains, but importantly offer potential avenues for moving forward with isotopic research in a more reflexive manner. Another article (Rivera Prince and Brock Morales *in press*) explicitly centers archaeological backdirt. We argue that backdirt---piles of dirt created from digging units in an archaeological excavation---is largely ignored in the archaeological literature. My theorizing backdirts, exploring their various temporal, spatial, and processual properties, we demonstrate that backdirt is always in process, and has agency that explicitly influences archaeological practice.

Together, these projects work towards a more reflexive archaeological practice, not only in how we engage with others, but also the type of knowledge we produce with archaeological data and how those narratives work to promote and/or obscure particular narratives about the past and present day.

## **Community Relationships to the Archaeological Past and Archaeological Future in the Virú Valley of Perú**

Beginning in 2023, this project begins a long-term community-based archaeology program on the coastal Virú Valley of Peru. Together, we work to document local histories and contemporary conceptions of archaeological materials and sites from ancient coastal sites the region. Coastal communities do not necessarily share the same primary connections to archaeological places in their landscape, as has been explored and documented in highland communities of the Andes. As some of the communities near the coastal sites were settled (relatively) recently, ancestrality may not necessarily be a primary connection to place---and by extension archaeological sites and materials as icons and indexes of the past and a past people. This project also explores how the community engages with archaeological materials and their perceptions of archaeological research.

Throughout this project, local community members are to be involved in terms of input on research questions, approach to particular types of archaeological materials, and how they want that archaeological knowledge shared, both academically and back to the community.
